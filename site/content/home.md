# Thoughts and stuff

[Articles](articles.html)

Hey, welcome to my site. Here you will find an assortment of things, mainly bits
and pieces of code, articles about various things (but mainly programming), and
who knows what else really...

This site was generated with a custom static generator I built for fun, [source here](https://github.com).
